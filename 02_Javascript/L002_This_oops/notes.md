## Inheritance : High Level Intro
    - Inheritance is related to OOPS.
    - Because we need a class to create an object just like for creating a house we need the architecture of the house.
    - Suppose we have architecture having 1 door and 2 rooms. Now we want to create a new house with this architecture along with it we also   want a swimming pool.
    - So we will inherit all the properties of the old architecture and add a swimming pool to it.
    - Then we will create a house with that new architecture.
